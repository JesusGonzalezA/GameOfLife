# Game of life

The Game of life is a popular cellular automaton. It is Turing complete and can simulate any other Turing machine. 

You can interact with the game by drawing an initial state or using a seed, which automatically generates a random initial state. Just it, the evolution will do the rest.

## Rules
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. 
* Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Tools
I implemented the game using React and redux. Feel free to ask, contribute or send me some feedback about this project.

## Interest
I did this game because I found it really interesting when studying computability theory in my degree. In addition, I found it challenging to do it using React.
